# Assignment1_DataCollectionAndCuration

data.world dataset: https://data.world/achydaman/assignment1datacollectionandcuration

I wanted to track the increase in price for a super bowl ad from the beginning to now. Wanted being the key word.

The APIS I used: 
Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html)
Wikipedia API (Just website scraping, but I originally used this one: https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/ . It's not official but I think it's fine)

Go to the data.world page to read about the troubles I had, plus additional information on the data
